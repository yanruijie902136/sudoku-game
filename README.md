# Sudoku Game

This is a simple Sudoku game written in Python using
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). You can install pygame by running

```(shell)
python -m pip install pygame
```

After that, run

```(shell)
python main.py
```

and a Sudoku puzzle will appear on your screen.

## TODOs

- Add Sudoku variants such as Killer Sudoku or Jigsaw Sudoku.
